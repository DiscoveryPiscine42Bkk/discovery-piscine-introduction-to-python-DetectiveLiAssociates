Re.: PROJECT EXPLANATION BASIS

A. INSTRUCTION:

    The Basic Chessboard and Checkmate Calculation using Separate Library File:
    checkmate.py

B. RESPONSE:

    We create Basic Chessboard and Mathematical Engine to calculate the Attacking
    Behavior when chess pieces Queen(Q), Bishop(B), Rook(R), Pawn(P) is within the
    distance toward a King(K).

C. PERFORMANCE:

    1. Basic Chessboard
    
    2. If King(K) Attack Path is Detected based on each Queen(Q), Bishop(B), Rook(R),
       Pawn(P) Attacking Behavior Patterns, print SUCCESS!

    3. If King(K) managed to survive, print SURVIVES!

D. SOLUTION:

    1. The chess pieces Queen(Q), Bishop(B), Rook(R), Pawn(P) and King(K) shall be placed
       manually on the chessboard using chess Translated coordinates
    
    2. We list all Mathematical Move Pattern Formulas under separate Functions.

    3. All of those Mathematical Functions would then be integrated under conditional use
       within the primary Checkmate Fundtion.

    4. The Mathematical Function for Queen(Q) would be the GROUPED Functions of Rook Moves
       Pattern and Bishop Moves Pattern
